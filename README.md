# NewTabToDoList

Todo lists are great, but a lot of times they tend to hang in the background of all the other windows until you conciously decide to look at your todo list again.  With this simple web page, you can make your todo list the "New Tab" page of your favorite browser, thus forcing you to see your todos with every tab you open.

## For Safari
Simple clone this repo to the folder of your choice and in Safari>Preferences>General, set the homepage to the absolute path of index.html in the repo.

## For Chrome
Since Chrome doesn't natively provide a customizable new tab page, you must install a simple extension (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/replace-new-tab-page/cnkhddihkmmiiclaipbaaelfojkmlkja). From there, select the Replace-New-Tab-Page icon and click "options" and set the URL to the asolute path of index.html in the repo.
